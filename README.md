# Objective
This project is based on the bookings made by customers on an online restaurant reservation platform. The goal of to analyze when new members typically make their first bookings, with a specific focus on identifying the average and median booking times. Imagine that EZTABLE would like to start a promotion for new members to make their bookings earlier in the day. This analysis will help EZTABLE in strategizing such promotion to encourage early-day bookings, thereby potentially optimizing restaurant reservations and customer flow.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of a sample drawn from a larger population which records the time and day each booking was made by a new customer.

# Tasks

* Load the data and convert _datetime_ into a POSIXlt date-time format.
* Calculate the time of each booking in minutes since the start of the day. Store the result in a new variable - _minday_.
* Plot the density of _minday_.
